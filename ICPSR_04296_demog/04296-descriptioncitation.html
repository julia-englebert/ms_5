		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The social and demographic data included in this
 collection consist of a single data file for each decennial year
 between 1870 and 2000, covering 10 of the 12 Great Plains states.
 Information on a variety of social and demographic topics was gathered
 to historically characterize populations living in counties within the
 United States Great Plains, in terms of: (1) urban, rural, and total
 population, (2) vital statistics, (3) net migration, (4) age and sex,
 (5) nativity and ancestry, (6) education and literacy, (7) religion,
 (8) industry, and (9) housing and other characteristics. These data
 include selected material compiled as part of the United States
 population census. The United States Census of Population and Housing
 has been conducted since 1790 on a regular schedule that is
 decennial. The county-level social and demographic data produced by
 the United States government as a result constitute a consistent
 series of measures capturing changes in the United States population's
 size, composition, and other characteristics. A subset of the
 variables available from the short and long-form survey questionnaires
 of the United States Census of Population and Housing (as compiled for
 counties) were extracted from previously existing digital files.
 Besides the decennial census of the population, county-level data were
 drawn from an assortment of existing digital files as well as sources
 that were manually digitized. Other data include compilations of
 county-level information gathered from various federal agencies and
 private organizations as well as the agriculture and economic
 censuses. Supplementing these compilations are manually digitized
 consumer market data, religious data, and vital statistics, including
information about births, deaths, marriage, and divorce.</p></span></p>

		        		<h2>Scope of Project:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Time Period(s):</strong> 1870 -- 2000</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> 1995 -- 2004</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> (1) A detailed list of census and other documents used
 to compile these data is provided in the codebook. (2) Every attempt
 has been made to give the variables consistent names, as shown in the
 documentation for these files. It is important for data users to
 recognize that there are sometimes significant but subtle differences
 between what may appear to be the same variable in two different
 census years. Where possible, the technical documentation emphasizes
 those differences, but to be certain of those differences, the data
user may need to do his or her own exploration into the sources.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>Data drawn from the Consumer Market Data Handbook, the
 Census of Religious Bodies, the Survey of Church Membership, and Vital
 Statistics of the United States are not collected from a sample.
 Details of data collection procedures for religion and vital
 statistics information are available from the <a
 href="http://www.thearda.com">American Religion Data Archive</a> and
 the United States Department of Health and Human Services [Report
 (PHS) 97-1003, 1997].</p> <p>However, the United States Census of
 Population and Housing does collect some information from samples of
 persons and housing units. With the universe of all persons and
 housing units in the United States, the following summarizes the
 sampling methodology used in the United States Population Census from
 1870 to 2000 (United States Department of Commerce, April 2002):</p>
 <p><strong>Sampling for the 1870-1930 United States Censuses</strong></p>
 <p>No sampling information was available for the years 1870 to
 1930. Data represent 100 percent counts of the United States
 population.</p> <p><strong>Sampling for the 1940 United States
 Census</strong></p> <p>The person was the sampling unit in 1940. The
 sample data collected information from 5 percent of the
 population.</p> <p><strong>Sampling for the 1950 United
 States Census</strong></p> <p>The person was the
 sampling unit in 1950. The sample data collected population and
 housing information for 20 percent of the population.</p>
 <p><strong>Sampling for the 1960 United States
 Census</strong></p> <p>The sample data population
 questions were asked of 25 percent of the population. For the housing
 sample data, some questions were asked of 5 percent of the population,
 some of 20 percent, and some of both (constituting a 25 percent sample
 for those questions).</p> <p><strong>Sampling for the
 1970 United States Census</strong></p> <p>The housing
 unit was the sampling unit. For the sample data, some questions were
 asked of 5 percent of the population, some of 15 percent, and some of
 both (constituting a 20 percent sample for those questions).</p>
 <p><strong>Sampling for the 1980 United States
 Census</strong></p> <p>For the STF3, one-half of all
 housing units and persons in group quarters in incorporated places of
 less than 2,500 persons were included in the sample. In all other
 places, one-sixth of the housing units or persons in group quarters
 were sampled. When both sampling rates were taken into account,
 approximately 19 percent of the nation's housing units were included
 in the census sample.</p> <p><strong>Sampling for the
 1990 United States Census</strong></p> <p>A sample of
 persons and housing units was asked more detailed questions about such
 items as income, occupation, and housing costs in addition to the
 basic demographic and housing information. The primary sampling unit
 for the 1990 census was the housing unit, including all occupants. For
 persons living in group quarters, the sampling unit was the
 person. Housing units in governmental units with a precensus (1988)
 estimated population of fewer than 2,500 persons were sampled at
 1-in-2. Housing units in census tracts and block numbering areas
 (BNAs) with a precensus count below 2,000 housing units were sampled
 at 1-in-6 for those portions not in small governmental units
 (governmental units with a population less than 2,500). Housing units
 within census tracts and BNAs with 2,000 or more housing units were
 sampled at 1-in-8 for those portions not in small governmental units.
 Persons in group quarters were sampled at a 1-in-6 rate.</p>
 <p><strong>Sampling for the 2000 United States
 Census</strong></p> <p>Every person and housing unit in
 the United States was asked basic demographic and housing questions,
 for example, race, age, relationship to householder, housing unit
 vacancy status, and housing unit tenure. A sample of these people and
 housing units was asked more detailed questions about items such as
 income, occupation, and housing costs. The sampling unit for Census
 2000 was the housing unit, including all occupants. There were four
 different housing unit sampling rates: 1-in-8, 1-in-6, 1-in-4, and
 1-in-2 (designed for an overall average of about 1-in-6). The Census
 Bureau assigned these varying rates based on precensus occupied
 housing unit estimates of various geographic and statistical entities,
 such as incorporated places and interim census tracts. For people
 living in group quarters or enumerated at long-form eligible service
 sites (shelters and soup kitchens), the sampling unit was the person,
and the sampling rate was 1-in-6.</p></span></p>
