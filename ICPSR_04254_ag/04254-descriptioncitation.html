		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The data in this series of studies were assembled by an
interdisciplinary research team led by Myron Gutmann of the University
of Michigan between 1995 and 2004, as part of a research project
funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(Grant Number R01HD033554 to the University of Michigan). The goal of
the project was to amass information about approximately 500 counties
in 12 states of the Great Plains of the United States, and then to
analyze those data in order to understand the relationships between
population and environment that existed between the years of about
1870 and 2000. The data distributed here are all data about
counties. They fall into four broad categories: about the counties,
about agriculture, about demographic and social conditions, and about
the environment. The information about counties (name, area,
identification code, and whether the project classified the county as
part of the Great Plains in a given year) is embedded in each of the
other data files, so that there will be three series of data
(agriculture, demographic and social conditions, and environment),
containing individual data files for each year for which data are
available. The United States Census of Agriculture has been conducted
since 1850 on a regular schedule that was decennial until 1920, and
more frequently thereafter (every five years from 1925 to 1950, then
in 1954, 1959, 1964, 1978, and every five years since 1982). The
agricultural data included in this collection consist of a single data
file for each agricultural census year between 1870 and 1997 that
includes selected material compiled as part of the United States
Agricultural Census. The county-level agricultural data produced by
the United States government as part of the census constitute a
consistent series of measures of changing agriculture and land use.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>The first comprehensive United States Census of
 Agriculture in 1850 imposed a limit below which no tract of land was
 to be considered a farm. If the value of produce from small farm lots
 fell below $100 in value, they were to be excluded from the count of
 census farms. In 1870, the minimums rose to reflect economic change
 and to help sort out some of the confusion that emerged in the South
 with emancipation, including the subdivision of plantations and
 attendant uncertainties in proprietorship. The preamble to the 1870
 census declared that "[n]o farm will be reported of less than three
 acres, unless five hundred dollars' worth of produce has actually been
 sold off from it during the year." This same definition was applied in
 1880 and 1890.</p> <p>In the 1900 preamble, census officials
 explained a return to the original standard of 1850 and offered some
 cautionary advice. In reviewing the changing definition of census
 farms they noted that in "no [agricultural] census of the country had
 one-half of the farms reported products of a value of $500, and the
 proportion that had sold products of that value was much smaller. The
 land occupied and the products secured by very many persons devoting
 their entire time to caring for small dairies, apiaries, florists'
 establishments, and kindred agricultural establishments were omitted
 from reports, although those persons were properly included in the
 occupation tables as dairymen, apiarists, florists, etc." Because of
 these omissions from tabulated results in 1870, 1880, and 1890, census
 marshals issued revised instructions to enumerators in 1900 that were
 far more inclusive. This occupational and self-declared basis for
 defining farms is further clarified by the explicit inclusion of
 market-gardens, orchards, nurseries, cranberry marshes, greenhouses
 and city dairies, <em>provided</em>, [emphasis in the
 original] the entire time of at least one individual is devoted to
 their care.</p> <p>By 1910, size and production minimums
 returned in a definition that retained language about farms as the
 agricultural operations of self-described farmers, with the added
 provision that they again be tracts of farmland at least three acres
 in size, no matter what the value of their produce, or if they fell
 below the size minimum, that they employ the continuous services of at
 least one person or produce at least $250 worth of farm products. This
 definition was applied again in 1920, 1925, 1930, 1935, 1940, and
 1945. However the value of production for farms under three acres was
 not adjusted for inflation or deflation. The inclusion or exclusion of
 very small farms in the census during these years relied, in part, on
 changes in the price of agricultural commodities.</p>
 <p>In 1950, farms of three or more acres were included in the
 census only if the value of their produce from the previous crop year,
 in 1949, amounted to $150, and similarly operations under three acres
 in size were included only if they met the minimum of $150 in sales
 from the previous year.</p> <p>In 1959, the farm size and
 product value minimums were adjusted again. The farm size minimum was
 raised to ten acres, with sales of at least $50, and if farms fell
 below ten acres, they were required to have estimated sales of at
 least $250. Farms that fell below either of these product value
 minimums were included in the census if they could be expected to meet
 them under normal conditions. The same census definition of census
 farms was applied in 1964.</p> <p>The biggest change in
 process came in 1969 with the switch from face-to-face enumeration to
 enumeration by mail. Nonsample "short" forms were mailed to every
 respondent on the Census Bureau's mailing list, a list furnished by
 the United States Department of Agriculture.  By law, everyone on the
 list was required to respond to the nonsample form. Respondents who
 reported sales or acreage above specified levels on nonsample forms
 were then sent correspondence requesting additional sample data. To
 limit respondent burden, the nonsample form included only questions to
 be reported at the county level. All county-level data are based on
 the nonsample form.</p> <p>The biggest change in
 definition occurred in 1974 when the acreage criterion was dropped and
 a farm was defined as a place from which $1,000 in agricultural
 products was produced and sold, or normally would have been sold. The
 use of sales as the basic criterion meant that operations that focused
 on household use or non-commercial distribution were no longer
 regarded as farms. It is estimated that this change defined 300,000
 farms out of existence nationally, an estimate made more precise by
 the count of farms using both definitions in the 1974 Agricultural
 Census and the 1980 Population Census (Bruce L. Gardner, American
 Agriculture in the Twentieth Century: How It Flourished and What It
 Cost. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 2002: 51-52). The $1,000
 sales criterion persisted until the end of the twentieth
 century.</p> <p>Adjustments were made to enumeration by
 mail in 1978 to improve coverage, including a revised mail list and
 the adoption of a direct area enumeration sample, including the use of
 aerial photography, as a data checking method.</p> <p>In
 1982, 3,653,000 nonsample forms were mailed in late December to
 individuals, businesses and organizations on the mail list. Data
 collection included a reminder card and five follow-up letters.
 Further follow-up was conducted by mail and telephone for
 nonrespondents in 14 states, and adjustments made to the final
 results. All new farm successors reported by former operators were
 researched to see if they had been included in the census mailing.
 Report forms mailed to successor addresses not previously on the mail
 file improved the coverage of the results.</p> <p>Since
 1987, coverage evaluation reports have accompanied the publication of
 the agricultural census to provide estimates of the completeness of
 the enumeration. In 1997, the use of post-census sampling by the USDA
 increased the count of United States farms from 1.97 to 2.06
million.</p></span></p>
